            <h2>Public health strategies</h2>
            <p>Since the end of 2000s, the world has known numerous outbreaks of arboviruses, such as Zika, Dengue or Chikungunya. This phenomenon is strongly linked with the expansion of <i>Aedes albopictus</i> worldwide, especially in Western Europe. The recent outbreaks of Dengue and Chikungunya viruses in south of Frane highlight that this threat is not gonna to stop in the next few years. It is therefore crucial to develop public health strategies that are able to decrease the probability and the magnitude of these outbreaks.</p>
						<p>To this extent, we are developing cutting-edge sophisticated mathematical models that consider multiple surveillance routes, economic efficiency and spatio-temporal dynamics of these outbreaks. We are developing these models  on metropolitan France, Martinique island and the European continent to provide relevant decision-making tools. Moreover, since chemical insecticide has a limited efficacy, we are also developing new approach based on digital social networks analysis to quantify human behavior regarding risk of vector-borne pathogens</p>
