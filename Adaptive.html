            <h2>Adaptive therapy against cancer</h2>
            <p>Tumor growth is the consequence of a variety of phenomena starting with mutated cancer cells. It has become clear that other actors play a role to sustain and modulate growth as well as treatment response. Among the latter actors we predominantly find immune cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. All of them contribute to the installation of a complex intercellular network. We call it the tumoral microenvironment ecosystem (TMEE). Understanding the TMEE functional structure and its changes upon drug treatment is crucial to improve cancer therapy and avoid, or at least delay, treatment resistance.</p>
						<p>One very promising avenue is the development of adaptive therapies. Relying on a deep ecological and evolutionary knowledge of cancer ecosystem, it proposes to administrate drug dose much lower than the maximal tolerated one in order to keep competition between cellular population, and especially sensitive and resistant cancer cells</p>
						<p> Using transcriptomics and 3D imaging, we aim applying advanced network biology algorithms and mathematical modeling techniques to identify the best treatment algorithms. We will investigate lung cancer in experimental settings with mice, as well as gliboblastoma in humans to forecast what could be the most efficients treatment protocol.</p>
