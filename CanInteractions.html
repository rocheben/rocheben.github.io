            <h2>Interactions between non-oncogenic pathogens and cancer development</h2>
            <p>Pathogens are increasingly recognized as a causation of cancer, with several oncogenic pathogens being direct etiologic agents for certain cancers. However, even if they are not directly involved in cellular transformation, pathogens could also mould cancer incidence and evolution because immune reactions against pathogens and cancer cells are not independent, which could hamper or exacerbate efficiency of immune system to eliminate cancer cells.</p>
						<p> Combining experimental and epidemiological approaches, I aim characterizing how pathogen communities, especially viruses, circulating in human populations can impact cancer evolutionary dynamics and incidence in order to anticipate their detrimental consequences as well as better understanding how ecological population process may impact within-host clonal evolutionary dynamics.</p>
