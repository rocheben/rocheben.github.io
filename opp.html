						<h2>Opportunities</h2>

						<h3>PhD Fellowship with Nathalie Charbonnel</h3>

						<p>Deciphering the links between biodiversity and health : rodents, microbiota and zoonotic pathogens </p>
<p>Keywords : microbial ecology, infectious diseases, ecohealth, wildlife, dilution effect, conservation biology, association network</p>

<h4>Profile and skills required </h4>
<p>The student must have an excellent background in population biology, (microbial/community) ecology and biostatistics. Interests in field work, molecular biology, bioinformatics and modeling approaches are essential to this project. We do not expect candidates to have experience in all these fields, but the candidate should be interested in, and not afraid of, mixing these different approaches and techniques. Multi-tasking and organizational skills will be necessary and appreciated. As this PhD will be part of a European project, the candidate is expected to exchange with other PhDs and post-docs from Germany, Ireland, Poland and Belgium (practice of english required). </p>

<p>Project description</p>
<p>Context</p>
<p>Understanding the relationships between wildlife biodiversity and zoonotic infectious diseases when ecosystems are strongly disturbed is a challenging issue that scientists must address to support further policy actions. This PhD project aims at tackling this challenge by focusing on rodent-borne diseases in temperate forests or large urban green spaces. Rodents, that are important reservoirs of threatening zoonotic agents, are extremely abundant within forests and green spaces environments where human/domestic-wildlife interactions are plausible to occur. Within these ecosystems, efforts are undertaken to preserve biodiversity throughout Europe, with therefore possible consequences for public health strategies against many zoonoses.
The originality of this project is to extend previous research on biodiversity/health relationships by including: i) impact of coinfections on epidemiology of thoses zoonoses, ii) interactions between gut microbiome and host susceptibility to infectious agents, iii) temporal variability of biodiversity/health relationships.</p>

<p>Objectives</p>
<p>The candidate will participate in biannual rodent sampling and perform large investigation of zoonotic agents and microbiome using metabarcoding to describe the biodiversity of rodent community and their pathobiome. He/she will apply eco-epidemiological approaches to decipher the processes that influence zoonotic pathogen transmission in rodent populations. Mathematical models will be developed to quantify the influence of spatiotemporal scales and within-host interactions on the relationships between biodiversity (rodents and microbiome) and zoonotic diseases. Such models would be used afterwards to forecast the public health consequences of conservation strategies.</p>
