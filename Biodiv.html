            <h2>Biodiversity and health</h2>
            <p>Major advances in the understanding and control of infectious diseases have been achieved over the past hundred years. However, the persistence and re-emergence of serious public health concerns, illustrated by the recent examples of Ebola virus in western Africa or Zika in South America, have gloomed the most optimistic scenarios. While numerous factors (environmental, climatic or social among others) have been associated with these events, the role of biological diversity alteration resulting from habitat destruction is receiving an increasing attention these last years.</p>
						<p>However, the scientific community is struggling to find a clear role of biodiversity in these emergences. Most of this intense scientific debate relies on the biodiversity paradox that could result from anthropization processes. One the one hand, high vertebrate diversity can "dilute" transmission of some pathogens and anthropization processes that erode vertebrate biodiversity may therefore increase their transmission. On the other hand, this vertebrate diversity is also extremely tied up with a high diversity of micro-organisms, thus more pathogens may circulate within highly diverse vertebrate communities. This scientific dispute is extremely detrimental because it avoids the possibility to create a win-win strategy by using biological conservation as a public health tool.</p>
						<p>To clarify this biodiversity paradox, we aim at characterizing the whole chain of events that goes from anthropization to pathogen exposure of human populations through biodiversity erosion. To this extent, we are mostly working in Mexico on hantaviruses and flaviviruses. Then, we will consider the reciprocal feedbacks between land-use alteration, modification of host communities, the influence of within-host microbial spheres on susceptibility to zoonotic pathogens, and exposure factors of human populations. Once each part of this chain has been robustly quantified, we envision forecasting through cutting-edge mathematical modeling what could be the impact of biological conservation strategies on expected epidemiological patterns of zoonotic pathogens outbreaks in human populations. Overall, this project will provide the proof-of-concept that such joint strategies between public health and conservation biology programs can represent new opportunities to avoid emergence of zoonotic pathogens. </p>
